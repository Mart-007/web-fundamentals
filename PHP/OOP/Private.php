// Private
// In the previous lesson, we saw how to restrict access to properties and methods by using the protected access modifier. This removes any visibility outside the object or its children. What if we had a property or method that we didn't want our child class to access either? To do this, we set the visibility to private.

// Marking a member as private
// Setting the keyword private in front of the property or method makes it available only within the scope of the current class. It cannot be inherited or called by any other code. In the following example, we set our $base_property member to private.

class MyBaseClass
{
    public function __construct($instance)
    {
        echo "I am called for object: " . $instance."<br>";
    }
    // Note: in the previous example, this was marked 'protected'
    private $base_property = 0;
    // Note: in the previous example, this was marked 'public'
    protected function set_the_property($prop_value)
    {
        $this->base_property = $prop_value;          //  I can always see/set my own attributes
    }
}
class MyChildClass extends MyBaseClass
{
    public function directly_set_property($prop_value)
    {
        // 'private' makes MyBaseClass::base_property unavailable, even to child classes.
        $this->base_property = $prop_value;         // This causes an error -- cannot access prop_value 
    }
    public function child_sets_property($prop_value)
    {
        // 'protected' makes MyBaseClass::set_the_property() visible to child classes like this one.
        $this->set_the_property($prop_value);      // This will work well. 
    }
}
$child = new MyChildClass('child'); 
$base = new MyBaseClass('base');
// 'private' makes $base_property unavailable outside the class itself
$child->base_property = 68;                         // Nope! This will cause an error
$base->base_property = 86;                          // Nope! This will cause an error
// $base_property is even inaccessible by child classes.
$child->directly_set_property(68);                // Nope! We can call the method, but it then fails
// 'protected' makes set_the_property() invisible outside itself and child classes.
// $child->set_the_property(68);                      // Nope! We can't access that method from out here.
// $base->set_the_property(86);                       // Nope! We can't access that method from out here. 
// from inside the child_sets_property() public method, we can access protected attributes
$child->child_sets_property(42);                   // YES!  This works wonderfully well.
// and remember that parent objects don't "reverse-inherit" the methods/members of their children!
// $base->directly_set_property(86);                  // Nope! MyBaseClass contains no method with that name
// $base->child_sets_property(86);                    // Fail! $base doesn't even have a child_sets_property()!
